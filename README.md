# Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment
<h3>  Overview</h3>
<hr>
<p> Welcome to my "Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment" Google Cybersecurity Certificate  Project using the Process of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) framework! In this project, we'll embark on a journey to assess the security posture of a new app developed for shopping enthusiasts and collectors. Using the PASTA framework, we'll meticulously analyze potential threats and vulnerabilities to ensure the safety and integrity of the application before its launch.</p>
<h3> Scenario</h3>
